Basics:
  - Get player control module
  - Basic Item/Weapon functionality. Start off easy, ability to equip. Worry about general functions later. 
  - Figure out map making tool. Start experimenting with adding terrain, buildings, props, etc...
  - UI, Settings menu, etc...

Graphics:
  - Basic rendering system with lots modularity to add more advanced graphics later like real time shadows, lighting, etc...
  - Focus on performance over quality, at least until a few builds in where we're comfortable in upgrading.
  
  Ideas: Sim-lite/Sim-cade style combat game. Ability to simulate real-life weapons, gear, utilities, and vehicles to a somewhat balanced, but fun manner.
  Items/Weapons/Gear/Vehicles:
    - Basic generic guns at first, get a working template for each type of firearm:
      - Select-Fire (Semi, Full/Burst; ARs, SMGs, LMGs, etc...)
      - Semi-Auto (Pistols, everything else semi-auto)
      - Bolt/Pump/Manual action weapons (Shotguns, Bolt action rifles)
    - Vehicle support: (more information, mainly about air combat on "Aircrat Part 1" in main repository.
      - Land/Air/Sea based controllers
 Stance System:
   Off-hand(Standing) - Lean left/right, blindfire around corners/walls left/right. Idle, Low-Ready, Aiming
   Kneeling - same as above 
   Prone, on stomach - rolling, ^
   Prone, on back - ^
