- Loadout:
  - Ability to change aircraft loading (bombs, missiles, flare pods, extra fuel tanks, smoke, fuel amount)


- Multiplayer/General Gameplay
	- Ranking/competitive system(?)
	- Ability to fly as passenger in two or more seat aircraft (and ability to assist during differing gamemodes)
	- Ability to spectate
	- Ability to restrict various aircraft/features based on different variables
	- Unarmed aircraft are only available in Free-Flight mode
		- Disable by aircraft model/type/role, max speed, max thrust, RCS(Stealth), era (before/after/between x year(s), max turn rate/radius, max AOA/G-limits, weapons (disable missiles)
	- Gamemodes:
		- Free-Flight 
			- Optional weapons and/or rogue AI disabled
			- IFF (Identify Friend/Foe) Selection (and ability to be changed during flight. Max 300s (5mins) between changes)
			- AI flying around with random IFF
				- AI may decide to go offensive/defensive and attack player based on different variables (proximity, pursuited for x amount of time, exhibiting defensive behaviour i.e. locking on/shooting at)
		- Air-Superiority (Free-For-All) (PvP, PvE/CO-OP)
			- No teams, every man for himself
			- Last standing fighter wins
		- Furball (Team Deathmatch) (PvP, PvE/CO-OP)
			- Multiple teams will fight for the last standing team
		- Standard
			- Standard dogfight mode (for players and AI)
			- X vs. x (1v1, 1v2, 2v2, etc...)
			- max 12 players (adjustable by host)
		- Bomber Interception (PvP, PvE/CO-OP)
			- Offensive team has up to 2 bombers and up to 4 fighter aircraft
			- Defensive team has up to 4 fighter aircraft
			- Offensive team must escort bomber to destroy a target area under specified time and defensive must stop them at all costs
			- If offensive bomber misses all attempts to hit target and has no remaining ammo, defensive team wins
			
		- Fighter Interception (PvP, PvE/CO-OP)
			- One team must defend and intercept a fighter entering restricted airspace
			- If offensive aircraft reaches certain distance into restricted airspace, offensive team wins
			- If offensive aircraft resides in restricted airspace for x amount of time, offensive team wins
			- If offensive aircraft is destroyed (engine/electronics failure/crashes/runs out of fuel), defensive team wins
			- If offensive aircraft exits restricted airspace for x amount of time, defensive team wins


- Hardware
	- Controller/Joystick support
	- Possibly VR support(?)	
	- simple, but decent graphics (think similiar to ysflight/tiny combat. ability to run on older systems and pc's with low specs)

- Misc. Features
	- AI that learn (neural networking possibly?)
	- Ability for Seaplanes to land on water
		- Seaplanes cannot land at speeds above 400 knots otherwise hull damage
	- Ability to eject (may count as loss depending on gamemode)
	- Option to refuel/rearm/repair upon landing at an airport/aircraft carrier
	- Ability to jettison (detach/dump) spare fuel tanks and a set percentage of main fuel
		- Dumped tanks/fuel removes weight adding decreasing weight thus increasing maneuverability
		- Dumped tanks explode on impact, can be used as bombs when out of ammo

- UI/GUI/HUD
	- Airspeed calculated in Knots
		- Machmeter displaying speed in mach)
	- Elevation calculated in Meters
	- Current armament displayed (with rounds remaining)
	- Health
	- Advanced HUD calculating roll/pitch/yaw/heading
	- Auto-GCAS (Automated Ground Collision Avoidance Software) for certain modern aircraft
		- IF player does not recover from loss of altitude due to blackout or lack of input for x amount of time, autopilot will engage and maintain level flight at specified value (player may manually set what altitude the system will maintain, 
	- TAWS (Terrain Awareness and Warning System)
		- A warning sound will play when aircraft descends below specified altitude or when approaching heightened terrain (hills/mountains)


- Damage
	- Landing gear deployed at airspeed/groundspeed of 300kts will cause gear to break, causing damage and/or crash
	- Damage to cockpit will cause electronics failure (and death to player based on proximity of missile explosion/bullets hitting player)
	- Damage to engine/fuselage will cause engine failure
	- Health values for wings/flaps/ailerons/stabilisers
		- Parts start falling off decreasing aircraft stability (causing flatspins and stalls)
	- Explosions/damage near fuel tanks cause chance of fire and/or explosion


- Radar:
	- 2D radar displayed at top right corner
	- Stealth planes with low RCS (Radar Cross Section) cannot be easily displayed/spotted/locked on
	- IFF (Identify Friend/Foe) System
		- Differentiate between Friendly/Enemy/Neutral
	- Aircraft with electronic warfare systems have ability to jam nearby enemy radar



- Aircraft Maneuvering/Handling/Characteristics/Features
	- Realistic flight model
	- Turn radius & turn rate multiplied by speed (faster you go, the longer it will take to complete a full turn)
	- Differing stability value per aircraft (some aircraft prone to stalls and flatspins from certain maneuvers)
	- Aircraft with TVC (thrust vectoring control) more maneuverable (2D & 3D TVC)
	- Ability to toggle AOA limiter/G-limiter (for certain aircraft)
	- Afterburner to reach speeds above cruising speed
	- VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Lift) capabilities for designated aircraft (F-35B, AV-8B, YAK-141)
- Effects
	- Contrails apear at leading edge and tips of wings
	- Audible sonic boom when aircraft and visible vapor cone traveling at or above the speed of sound (343 meters/sec or 666.739 knots)
	- Engine/Thrust emitters
	- visible flare	
	- Smoke/flame damage emitters


- G-Forces
	- Optional "G-Loc" or "blackout" to pilots from G-Forces from high G maneuvers
	- Positive G's will cause player to black out, and a "blackout" (black vignette) to appear
	- Negative G's will kill player (more than -2.5 G's will kill player) and cause extreme damage to aircraft and cause a "redout" (red vignette) to appear
	- Different Max-G values for certain planes
	- Planes that reach G-Force above Max-G value will have electronic/engine failure and/or wings to snap off
